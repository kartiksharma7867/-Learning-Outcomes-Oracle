# Learning Outcomes Oracle

## Project Description
The **Learning Outcomes Oracle** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a secure and transparent way to verify and retrieve learning outcomes for students. By leveraging blockchain technology, this project ensures that learning outcomes are immutable, trustworthy, and accessible.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Learning Outcomes Oracle is to revolutionize the way educational achievements are verified and shared. By creating a decentralized and tamper-proof system, we aim to:

1. Enhance trust in educational credentials.
2. Provide students with a secure and permanent record of their achievements.
3. Simplify the verification process for institutions and employers.
4. Promote transparency and integrity in the education sector.

## Key Features

1. **Ownership Management**:
   - Only the contract owner can verify and add learning outcomes.

2. **Immutable Records**:
   - Learning outcomes are stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and immutability.

3. **Efficient Retrieval**:
   - Outcomes can be easily retrieved using a combination of student ID and course ID.

4. **Event Emission**:
   - Emits an `OutcomeVerified` event whenever a new learning outcome is verified, enabling real-time tracking and integration with other systems.

5. **Timestamping**:
   - Each verified outcome includes a timestamp to provide a historical record of when it was added.
